# Cyclist Bike-Share Usage Analysis

## 🚴‍♂️ Overview

This project explores rider behavior in a bike-share program by analyzing over 700,000 rides from 2019 and 2020. The goal was to uncover patterns between **casual users** and **annual members**, and identify opportunities to improve service offerings, increase membership conversion, and tailor marketing strategies.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To differentiate usage patterns between casual riders and members and assess growth opportunities by answering:

- How do ride times and frequencies differ by user type?
- When do each user group typically ride?
- How did ride patterns change from 2019 to 2020?
- Where can we identify conversion potential or operational improvements?

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- **Ride Length**  
  Casual riders take **5–7x longer trips** on average, suggesting more leisure-oriented usage.  
  Members ride shorter, more frequent trips—likely for commuting.

- **Time of Day & Week**  
  Casual users peak during **weekends and midday**, while members dominate **weekday commuting hours**.

- **Year-over-Year Growth**  
  Casual ridership grew significantly in 2020, pointing to an opportunity for **membership growth** and **re-engagement strategies**.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel** – Data cleaning and transformation  
- **PowerPoint** – Report presentation and recommendations

## 🔍 Visuals & Insights

The analysis includes breakdowns of:

- Total rides by user type and year  
- Average ride length comparisons  
- Ride volume by hour and day of the week  
- Growth in casual user rides (YoY Q1 comparison)

## 💡 Recommendations

- **Improve Data Collection**  
  - Add seasonal data for full-year trend analysis  
  - Tag trip purposes (e.g., leisure, commute)  
  - Track when and why casual users become members  
  - Include bike type and ZIP-code level demographics

- **Future Analysis Suggestions**  
  - Explore weather’s impact on ride behavior  
  - Segment users by neighborhood for targeted marketing  
  - Analyze high-traffic start/end stations to optimize operations
